          <p>
            Bruxae are rare creatures, mostly living far from population
            centers. Those who decide to live near men avoid crowds and emerge
            from their shelters only at night.

            Fighting a djinn is extraordinarily difficult. They can fling off
            spells in an instant that the most accomplished human mages could
            never cast with years of preparation. What's more, by manipulating
            the element of air they can summon powerful storms, hurricanes, and
            gales.

            Dopplers have incredible intellect and cunning, as well as the
            ability to take on the form of any humanoid or animal. This would
            make dopplers supreme assasins or thieves had not nature endowed
            them with generous and timid spirits which make them avoid the
            shedding of blood at all costs.

          <p>
            Ghouls usually feed in small groups, at times led by an alghoul.
            Since they delight most in the taste of fresh carcasses, they appear
            wherever newly-dug graves are to be found: cemeteries, crypts,
            catacombs and battlefields.

          <p>
            Sylvans and Yakshas, a kindred species, are extremely rare woodland creatures whose appearance combines traits of goats and rotund men. These beings usually pose little danger, for they limit their contact with humans to playing harmless (though often bothersome) tricks and eating crops from their fields.

            During combat alghouls try risky maneuvers aimed at knocking their
            opponents to the ground so the others can finish the job by tearing
            them to shreds. Like a normal ghoul, an injured alghoul can fall
            into a frenzy and attack with blind fury.

            Alps are vampires that resemble bruxae in appearance. They usually
            take on the form of a woman, though they can also appear as
            animals.They attack at night and are most active when the moon is

          <p>
            At first glance, a stationary arachas often looks like a part of the forest undergrowth, a fact it uses to deadly advantage when hunting. It usually begins a battle by spitting venom, then tries to grab its prey with prehensile feelers in order to drag it within reach of its crushing pincers.

            Anyone who does come across an arachnomorph had best hope his conscience is clear and his worldly affairs are in order, for his life shall soon end, as not even the fastest man in the world can outrun them and only a few witchers can hope to slay them.

            Folk of simple or superstitious minds claim committing particularly rotten acts will bring down the wrath of the gods in the form of "barghests,".Witchers rarely believe in the gods, but they do accept that barghests exist and are always connected with some sequence of tragic events that happened in the past.

            As the name "plague maiden" suggests, these wraiths take the
            appearance of females, though exactly why that is remains a mystery.
            Some speculate they, like other such specters, arise from the
            powerful emotional charge associated with certain circumstances of
            death, such as death preceded by a long and particularly painful
            illness.

            Since shaelmaars are blind, they find their way by sensing vibrations and listening for sounds.

            Slyzards are often mistaken for wyverns or forktails. Yet make no

            confusing them for wyverns will end very badly for the confuser.
            While a wyvern can tear apart and devour an untrained man in
            seconds, only a slyzard can first bake him to a crisp with a waft of

Large quantities, however, will kill anything they touch, with mutations only prolonging an inevitable and painful death in such instances.
